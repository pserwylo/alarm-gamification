# Notes

You will be allocated a maximum amount of experience which you can earn if you don't snooze at all. If you wake up without snoozing, then you get that amount of experience. If, however, you start to snooze, then the amount of experience points up for grabs will diminish. Continue to snooze and it will start to go negative, subtracting from your total experience.

You'll level up at certain predefined experience levels.

Awards will also be available for milestones, such as:
 - Getting up without snoozing
 - Three consecutive days without snoozing
 - A week with less than five snoozes

## To social or not social

At this point, this is considered just for personal development. That is, there isn't really a need to intergrate with social networks at this stage. But, having said that, it kind of defeats one of the original reasons gamification was introduced in apps. There would obviously be some sort of drive to do better if people could see that you were succeeding. Also, it would hopefully make people laugh a little if they saw their mates wall: "You wont a gold bar for getting up without snoozing" and might pike their interest.

## Potential future directions

It would be interesting to expand this in the future, so that you could gamify arbitrary things. Examples could include:
 - Making lunch instead of buying lunch
 - Taking public transport instead of driving
 - etc...
